### Challenge From: [View Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/character-counter-znSgeWs_i6).  
**The challenge** was to build a responsive character counter app with a textarea that displays the live character count and limit. The application should handle things like maximum character limits, dynamic feedback, and a responsive design that works across various screen sizes.

Users should be able to:

- Enter text into a textarea
- See a live count of characters typed
- Set a custom character limit
- See a warning when exceeding the limit
- Toggle dark/light themes
- Exclude spaces if desired
- View approximate reading time
- View letter density statistics

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (optional)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
- Responsive design
